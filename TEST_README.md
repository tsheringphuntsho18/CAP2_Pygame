# Test Cases Documentation

## Introduction

This documentation outlines the resources used in the development of test cases for our project. Test cases are crucial for ensuring the functionality and reliability of the software.

## Resources Used

### Pygame Library

- **Description:** Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It provides functionalities for graphics, sound, and user input.
- **Justification:** Pygame was chosen due to its simplicity and versatility in handling game development. It provides an intuitive framework for creating game-related functionalities and graphical interfaces, which suits the requirements of our project.

### Python Unittest Module

- **Description:** The `unittest` module is a built-in Python library used to create test cases.
- **Justification:** Python's `unittest` module offers a structured way to create and run test cases. Its simplicity in setting up and executing test cases allows for efficient testing of various components within our software.

### GitHub for Version Control

- **Description:** GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git.
- **Justification:** GitHub was utilized for version control to maintain the project's codebase, track changes, collaborate among team members, and ensure a centralized repository for the test cases and related documentation.

## Development Process

- **Planning:** Test cases were developed based on a comprehensive analysis of the software requirements and design specifications.
- **Implementation:** Test cases were written using Python and the Pygame library, following best practices to cover different scenarios and functionalities.
- **Testing:** The `unittest` module facilitated the execution of test cases, allowing us to verify the expected behavior of the software components.

## Future Considerations

- **Expansion:** Additional test cases can be created to cover edge cases and enhance the overall test coverage.
- **Integration:** Test automation frameworks could be integrated to automate the execution of test suites, streamlining the testing process.

## Conclusion

The selection of Pygame for game-related functionalities, coupled with Python's `unittest` module and version control through GitHub, provided a robust framework for developing and managing our test cases. Continuous improvement and expansion of test coverage remain essential for ensuring the reliability and quality of our software.
